# Steam Wishlist Combination Generator

A simple, unoptimized python script that helps me decide which games to buy from my wishlist.

> âš  **Notice**  
> As of **November 2024**, grabbing wishlist data from the following URLs no longer works:  
>
> - `https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/profiles/{}/wishlistdata?p={}`  
> - `https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/{}/wishlistdata?p={}`  
>
> Steam has likely changed their wishlist API, and an alternative method may be required.

This script uses [Augmented Steam's](https://github.com/IsThereAnyDeal/AugmentedSteam) wishlist export to json function.

## Setup and Usage

- Clone this repository
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run script

Optionally

- Install [Augmented Steam](https://augmentedsteam.com/)

![Chrome download link](https://developer.chrome.com/static/docs/webstore/branding/image/UV4C4ybeBTsZt43U4xis.png) [![Firefox download link](https://extensionworkshop.com/assets/img/documentation/publish/get-the-addon-178x60px.dad84b42.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/augmented-steam/)

- Export your wishlist to a json file named `wishlist.json`

## Optional Variables

Optionally, change currency inside the utils/constants.py, line 3 `CURRENCY = "<currency>"`, currently it's in my currency but it should work still

```py
CURRENCY = "<currency>"
```
